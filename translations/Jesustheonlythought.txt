Jesus! the only thought of Thee
Gives joy and true serenity :
But, oh, than honey far more sweet
Our Saviour face to face to meet!

No song can be so sweet to hear,
No sound so well the heart can cheer,
The mind no thought so glad can frame
As Jesus Christ's most holy name.

O Jesus! kind to sinners' fears,
And kind to anxious suppliant prayers,
To those who seek for thee, how kind!---
What then art thou to those who find?

No tongue can make the hearer guess,
Now writing say how thou dost bless :
Those only who have tried can tell
What 'tis to love their Jesus well.

Jesus, our only bliss be thou,
Who wilt all future joy bestow!
Oh, let our love and glory be
For endless ages drawn from thee.
