# parallelhymns

A suggestion - making a book with hymns set on facing pages in Latin and English.  Both sides notated with square notes.

Although it would be clever to do this all in the one tex file, I think it would be far easier to work with two tex documents then use a tool like pdfjam to interleave the pages.

Working from http://gregobase.selapa.net and the GABC Transcription Hymn Tool in Chrome.
